I am a Navy submarine veteran and am currently working as a Technical Support Engineer in Silicon Valley. My hobbies are cycling, surfing and traveling.

I am currently in Puerto Escondido, Mexico. We will be staying here for the quarter while I focus on school and my wife is taking Spanish lessons.
